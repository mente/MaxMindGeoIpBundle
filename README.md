Insomnia MaxGeoIp Bundle
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mente/MaxMindGeoIpBundle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mente/MaxMindGeoIpBundle)

Installation
====

This bundle helps you deliver MaxMind GeoIp functionality inside your symfony application. Based 
on [MaxMind library](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-php).

Installation is same as for other bundles:

    composer require mente/max-mind-geo-ip-bundle *

Don't forget to add bundle in your application kernel:

```php
<?php
    // app/AppKernel.php

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new \Insomnia\MaxMindGeoIpBundle\InsomniaMaxMindGeoIpBundle(),
        );
    }
```

Configuration is pretty straight forward:

```yaml
insomnia_max_mind_geo_ip:
    # Path to geolite2 database. Default is '%kernel.root_dir%/GeoIpCountry.mmdb'
    path: '%kernel.root_dir%/geolite2.mmdb'
```

After you've finished setting up code, it's time to update the most recent MaxMind database:

```bash
# If you want to use country-precision
php app/console insomnia:geoip:update http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb.gz
# OR
# If you want to use city-precision
# Keep in mind that city-precision database is bigger and it takes a bit longer time to find it by ip.
php app/console insomnia:geoip:update http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-City.mmdb.gz
```

Command will save and unpack database to destination specified in configuration. So you don't need to worry 
about correct placement.

**Hint**: if you want to automate database update, you can integrate it in your composer install/update phase 
using provided script handler. Add following to yours `composer.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "Insomnia\\MaxMindGeoIpBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::downloadMaxMindDB"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "Insomnia\\MaxMindGeoIpBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::downloadMaxMindDB"
    ]
},
"extra": {
    "maxmind-db-path": "app/geolite2.mmdb"
}
```

Extra part `maxmind-db-path` is required and should be same as `insomnia_max_mind_geo_ip.path` in symfony 
configuration. That's it! You're ready to start.

Usage
=====

Bundle exposes 2 services: `insomnia_max_mind_geo_ip` and `insomnia_max_mind_geo_ip_service`. Former is MaxMind 
pure database reader itself and latter is thin wrapper around it with several useful methods. For complete set 
of methods check `Insomnia\MaxMindGeoIpBundle\Service\GeoIpService`
